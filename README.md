# Netflix-Clone 
* A Netflix website clone has been created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Used some resources to help with this project, such as YouTube tutorials and GitHub repositories.
* The clone is still in its early stages and needs to be properly formed and enhanced.
* Specific improvements that could be made include adding more content, making the website more responsive, and adding features that allow users to search for content, create lists, and rate movies and TV shows.
